## Project : learning_portal_application

#### applied SDLC model(Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model) : 

For the project " **Learning Portal Application** " a suitable and simple Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model could be the Iterative Model. The Iterative Model involves repeating the development and testing phases in small increments, allowing for flexibility and adjustments based on feedback throughout the project.

![Phases-of-the-Iterative-Model-1024x585](https://github.com/Imran-2022/learning_portal_application/assets/91984650/8ae0fac0-6a51-457b-b6f5-cddfe260b41b)

In an ***iterative model*** the organisation starts
 with some of the software specification and develops the first version of the software. After the first version if there is a need to change the software then a new version of the software is created with a new iteration.
It will repeat until deployment of the software.

## Analysis

### 1. Requirements Gathering

Design and implement discussion forums for each course.
Enhance user profiles with additional information and customization options.

### 10. Iteration 4: Testing:

- Conduct testing for discussion forums and user profiles.
- **Gather feedback for final adjustments.**

### 11. Deployment:

- Deploy the Learning Portal Application with all iterations on a cloud server.
- Monitor the application in the live environment.

### 12. Maintenance and Support:

- Address any post-deployment issues promptly.
- Regularly update content, fix bugs, and make improvements based on user feedback.
- Plan for future iterations and enhancements.
The Iterative Model is suitable for a learning portal because it allows for continuous improvement based on user feedback and evolving requirements. Each iteration builds upon the previous one, ensuring a more robust and user-friendly learning platform over time.
