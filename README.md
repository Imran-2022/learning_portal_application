## Project: learning_portal_application

#### Applied SDLC model (Software Development Life Cycle model):

For the project "**Learning Portal Application**," a suitable and simple Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model could be the Iterative Model. The Iterative Model involves repeating the development and testing phases in small increments, allowing for flexibility and adjustments based on feedback throughout the project.

</p>

In an **iterative model** the organisation starts with some of the software specifications and develops the first version of the software. After the first version, if there is a need to change the software, then a new version of the software is created with a new iteration. It will repeat until the deployment of the software.

## Analysis
